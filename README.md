## Installation ðŸ—¹

### Using `pipx` to Install (preferred)

This package _could_ be installed using pip like any other Python package (in
fact, see the section below this one for instructions on how to do just that).
Given that we only need this package's entry points, however, we recommend that
[pipx][11] be used instead:

```shell
# install and setup pipx
python3 -m pip install --user pipx
python3 -m pipx ensurepath

# install greatday
pipx install greatday
```

### Using `pip` to Install

To install `greatday` using [pip][9], run the following
commands in your terminal:

``` shell
python3 -m pip install --user greatday  # install greatday
```

If you don't have pip installed, this [Python installation guide][10] can guide
you through the process.


## Command-Line Interface (CLI)

The output from running `greatday --help` is shown below:

<!-- [[[[[kooky.cog
import subprocess

popen = subprocess.Popen(["greatday", "--help"], stdout=subprocess.PIPE)
stdout, _ = popen.communicate()
print("```", stdout.decode().strip(), "```", sep="\n")
]]]]] -->
```
usage: greatday [-h] [-c CONFIG_FILE] [-L [FILE[:LEVEL][@FORMAT]]] [-v]
                [--version]
                {start,add} ...

Don't have a good day. Have a great day.

optional arguments:
  -c CONFIG_FILE, --config CONFIG_FILE
                        Absolute or relative path to a YAML file that contains
                        this application's configuration.
  -h, --help            show this help message and exit
  -L [FILE[:LEVEL][@FORMAT]], --log [FILE[:LEVEL][@FORMAT]]
                        This option can be used to enable a new logging
                        handler. FILE should be either a path to a logfile or
                        one of the following special file types: [1] 'stderr'
                        to log to standard error (enabled by default), [2]
                        'stdout' to log to standard out, [3] 'null' to disable
                        all console (e.g. stderr) handlers, or [4] '+[NAME]'
                        to choose a default logfile path (where NAME is an
                        optional basename for the logfile). LEVEL can be any
                        valid log level (i.e. one of ['CRITICAL', 'DEBUG',
                        'ERROR', 'INFO', 'TRACE', 'WARNING']) and FORMAT can
                        be any valid log format (i.e. one of ['color', 'json',
                        'nocolor']). NOTE: This option can be specified
                        multiple times and has a default argument of '+'.
  -v, --verbose         How verbose should the output be? This option can be
                        specified multiple times (e.g. -v, -vv, -vvv, ...).
  --version             show program's version number and exit

subcommands:
  {start,add}
    start
    add                 Add a new todo to your inbox.

## Design Diagrams

### State Diagrams

#### State Diagram for the `greatday start` Command

The below state diagram is kicked off when a user runs the `greatday start`
command.

Keep in mind the following notes while reviewing this diagram:

* We assume that it has been `N` days since your tickler Todos were last processed.

![diagram](./docs/design/design-1.svg)

#### State Diagram for Processing Todos

![diagram](./docs/design/design-2.svg)

### Class Diagrams

This section contains class diagrams used to help design / document greatday.

#### Class Diagram for `Todo` Classes

The following diagram illustrates how the various [magodo][1] `Todo` classes
interact.

Keep in mind the following notes while reviewing this diagram:

* The type variable `Self` is implicit and is always bound by the current class.
* The type variable `T` is bound by the `AbstractTodo` protocol.

![diagram](./docs/design/design-3.svg)

#### Class Diagram for `Repo` and `UnitOfWork` Classes

The following diagram illustrates how the various [potoroo][2] `Repo` and `UnitOfWork`
classes interact.

Keep in mind the following notes while reviewing this diagram:

* `V_or_None` is meant to be `Optional[V]`. There seems to be a bug in
  [mermaid][3], however, that prevents us from using `Optional[V]` as a generic
  type.
* Similarly, `VList` is meant to be `List[V]`.
* The type variable `Self` is implicit and is always bound by the current class.
* The type variable `R` is bound by the `BasicRepo` class.
* The type variables `K`, `V`, and `T` are all unbound.
